music generator notes:
	Generate two lines, and merge them together.
	Problem with playing them separately: will still require multiple threads
		b/c one line will need to hold or rest => sleep() thread, but that would stall the other one as well.
dynamics:


note lengths:



no need to sustain. just add reverb/feed-back loop
This means won't have to worry about pedalling and unpedalling
